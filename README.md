## 🚀 About the Project

**RememberText** is a multilingual ASP.NET Core web app that helps users store, orgenize, and memorize text more effectively.
It includes text comparison, user authentication, and full CRUD features - all build on a clean architecture (Domain, DAL, UI).

This app was my way of practicing almost every skill I listed on my CV - from frontend and backend development to working with SQL, raw queries, and authentication.

I built it with passion and a focus on problem-solving, usability, and future growth.
