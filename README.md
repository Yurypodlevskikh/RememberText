# RememberText

A simple and effective C# application for **remembering text and notes**, built with clean architecture (Domain, DAL, UI). Perfect as a learning project or a base to build on!

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**RememberText** helps you store, organize, and search your text fragments or notes. It's built with a multi-layered architecture that separates domain logic and data access (DAL).

## About the Project
I created **RememberText**, a multilingual web application designed to help users learn and memorize necessary material more effectively.

This app already offers useful functionality but has plenty of room for future improvements. Developing it allowed me to showcase my skills as a system developer:  
I have ideas, and I know how to implement them. I am able to successfully solve diverse challenges that arise during UI development and programming.

During the project, I used almost all the skills listed in my CV, including:
- ASP.NET Core MVC
- C#
- SQL Server
- Entity Framework Core
- Raw SQL Queries
- Stored Procedures
- JavaScript
- CSS3 and CSS Animation
- HTML
- Twitter Bootstrap
